/* Software timers
 * There is one of these structures for each simulated timer.
 * Whenever the timer is running, it is on a linked list
 * pointed to by "Timers". The list is sorted in ascending order of
 * expiration, with the first timer to expire at the head. This
 * allows the timer process to avoid having to scan the entire list
 * on every clock tick; once it finds an unexpired timer, it can
 * stop searching.
 *
 * Stopping a timer or letting it expire causes it to be removed
 * from the list. Starting a timer puts it on the list at the right
 * place.
